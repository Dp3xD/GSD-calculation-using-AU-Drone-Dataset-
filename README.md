– Objective: Developed a methodology to calculate Ground Sample Distance (GSD) using linear regression on UAV aerial imagery.
– Process of Implementation: Collected video frames, applied Gaussian blur, annotated objects, extracted features, and built a linear regression model for GSD calculation.
– Outcome: Achieved a nearly realistic model with non-zero errors, highlighting GSD’s critical role in object size and orientation determination.
– Tools and Technology, Algorithms Used: Utilized Python, pandas, CVAT.ai for annotation, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and linear regression.
